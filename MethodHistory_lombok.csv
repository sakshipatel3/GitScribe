Specifically, Rawi01's patches to make javadoc behaviour in eclipse better,
which cannot be applied to ecj as you get load errors (javadoc not a thing there).

As part of this commit, tests can be limited to ecj or eclipse, and I made cut-down
versions of a few tests (to run on ecj, as the main one cannot be, due to javadoc issues).

The tests now marked as eclipse only don't fail on ecj, but they don't generate the same
result. Alternatively, we could go with a separated out after-ecj and after-eclipse dir
instead, but that's perhaps going overboard.

We now test generating a level2-DOM from our level1-AST (eclipse has 3 levels of ASTs, more or less), only if
that is possible, i.e. only if the full eclipse is available. This requires using a test target named `eclipse-X`, and not
one of the `ecjX` ones. This is the change that requires the massive update to the build system. About 6 tests,
including a newly added one about @Delegate, now fail. These failures would usually not cause instant failure in
eclipse, but can cause errors during save actions and will likely mess with other things in weird ways, such as
messing up syntax highlighting.

Yes, this commit now makes a bunch of cases fail the unit tests, but that is representative of actual errors in lombok,
so I'm checking it in as is (without this commit, the problem is still there, the tests are just incapable of detecting it).

Specifically, Rawi01's patches to make javadoc behaviour in eclipse better,
which cannot be applied to ecj as you get load errors (javadoc not a thing there).

As part of this commit, tests can be limited to ecj or eclipse, and I made cut-down
versions of a few tests (to run on ecj, as the main one cannot be, due to javadoc issues).

The tests now marked as eclipse only don't fail on ecj, but they don't generate the same
result. Alternatively, we could go with a separated out after-ecj and after-eclipse dir
instead, but that's perhaps going overboard.

Specifically, Rawi01's patches to make javadoc behaviour in eclipse better,
which cannot be applied to ecj as you get load errors (javadoc not a thing there).

As part of this commit, tests can be limited to ecj or eclipse, and I made cut-down
versions of a few tests (to run on ecj, as the main one cannot be, due to javadoc issues).

The tests now marked as eclipse only don't fail on ecj, but they don't generate the same
result. Alternatively, we could go with a separated out after-ecj and after-eclipse dir
instead, but that's perhaps going overboard.

are ignored.

These handlers had methods with humongous argument lists, and they needed to grow even more in order
to accommodate some new needs to properly implement checkerframework (where annos can be type-use
based, which means they were being put in the wrong place.

void foo(com.foo.@X Bar paramName) // correct
void foo(@X com.foo.Bar paramName) // wrong

For example, the CalledMethod annotation is a type-use annotation.

This commit covers both that refactor and fixing checkerframework generation.

These handlers had methods with humongous argument lists, and they needed to grow even more in order
to accommodate some new needs to properly implement checkerframework (where annos can be type-use
based, which means they were being put in the wrong place.

void foo(com.foo.@X Bar paramName) // correct
void foo(@X com.foo.Bar paramName) // wrong

For example, the CalledMethod annotation is a type-use annotation.

This commit covers both that refactor and fixing checkerframework generation.

 * re-introduction of onMethod/onConstructor/onParam
 * tests checking error/warnings rewritten to be more heuristic, in order to accomodate difference in messaging between java6 and java 7
 * Ability to eliminate java's own output of erroneous error messages (heh); i.e. those messages that are invalidated by lombok's actions. This mechanism is used for onMethod/onConstructor/onParam
 * First steps to unifying a billion setGeneratedBy calls into a single visitor traversal for eclipse' HandleGetter/Setter/Constructor/Wither
 * To simplify 'zooming in' the tests on just a few files, added an 'accept' mechanism.
 * Updated copyright headers of website to 2013.

explicit builder class.
* Builder now takes @FieldDefaults/@Value into account.
* Builder on type now generates the constructor as package private
instead of private to avoid synthetic accessor constructors.
* added a bunch of test cases.
* added a test case feature: If the expected file is omitted entirely
but there are expected messages, the differences in the output itself
are ignored.
* streamlined checking for boolean-ness (removed some duplicate code)

* Conflict due to adding topic() feature to logger in master, and 'field name' feature in config branch.
* master has since updated to shiny new eclipse dep versions and the 'ant eclipseForDebugging' feature, but this branch added deps. Addressed that.
* Renamed 'loggerCategory' to 'loggerTopic'. I know, that wasn't exactly right to do in a merge, but, there you have it.

* Conflict due to adding topic() feature to logger in master, and 'field name' feature in config branch.
* master has since updated to shiny new eclipse dep versions and the 'ant eclipseForDebugging' feature, but this branch added deps. Addressed that.
* Renamed 'loggerCategory' to 'loggerTopic'. I know, that wasn't exactly right to do in a merge, but, there you have it.
* Test infrastructure changed in configuration branch, and tests had been added in master branch.

"8651","RequiredArgsConstructorWithAnnotations","RequiredArgsConstructorWithAnnotations","7","Body Change, Introduced, MultiChange","BIG commit:
 * re-introduction of onMethod/onConstructor/onParam
 * tests checking error/warnings rewritten to be more heuristic, in order to accomodate difference in messaging between java6 and java 7
 * Ability to eliminate java's own output of erroneous error messages (heh); i.e. those messages that are invalidated by lombok's actions. This mechanism is used for onMethod/onConstructor/onParam
 * First steps to unifying a billion setGeneratedBy calls into a single visitor traversal for eclipse' HandleGetter/Setter/Constructor/Wither
 * To simplify 'zooming in' the tests on just a few files, added an 'accept' mechanism.
 * Updated copyright headers of website to 2013.

This does break API for other plugins, but the fix is trivial: Just make your
'handle' method return void. That 'we won't call you again' business in the decks
never quite worked right anyway.

Also, you might want to call Javac.(recursive)setHandledBy when you generate nodes, now.

This does break API for other plugins, but the fix is trivial: Just make your
'handle' method return void. That 'we won't call you again' business in the decks
never quite worked right anyway.

Also, you might want to call Javac.(recursive)setHandledBy when you generate nodes, now.

code deduplication by removing HandleData's scanning for fields, which is now no longer done; the sub-parts of Data (Getter, Setter, RequiredArgsConstructor, etc) take care of it now.

fix for class-level @Getter/@Setter, which used to go for every field. Now they skip the usual fields (static, for setters final, and $ prefixed fields).

Bugfix for @Data not recognizing that it should let field-level @Getter/@Setter take care of generating the getter/setter for multi field declarations (@Getter int x, y);","ceda2e5efe229650d4e95de6b8a2632d9f616592","Reinier Zwitserloot"

fix for class-level @Getter/@Setter, which used to go for every field. Now they skip the usual fields (static, for setters final, and $ prefixed fields).

Bugfix for @Data not recognizing that it should let field-level @Getter/@Setter take care of generating the getter/setter for multi field declarations (@Getter int x, y);","ceda2e5efe229650d4e95de6b8a2632d9f616592","Reinier Zwitserloot"

via the LombokAST object. Instead its tracked more directly in an attempt
to avoid having to write all handlers as idempotent, and just in case
issue #164 is a race condition (the handled-or-not is a synchronized CAS check).

This does break API for other plugins, but the fix is trivial: Just make your
'handle' method return void. That 'we won't call you again' business in the decks
never quite worked right anyway.

Also, you might want to call Javac.(recursive)setHandledBy when you generate nodes, now.

 * re-introduction of onMethod/onConstructor/onParam
 * tests checking error/warnings rewritten to be more heuristic, in order to accomodate difference in messaging between java6 and java 7
 * Ability to eliminate java's own output of erroneous error messages (heh); i.e. those messages that are invalidated by lombok's actions. This mechanism is used for onMethod/onConstructor/onParam
 * First steps to unifying a billion setGeneratedBy calls into a single visitor traversal for eclipse' HandleGetter/Setter/Constructor/Wither
 * To simplify 'zooming in' the tests on just a few files, added an 'accept' mechanism.
 * Updated copyright headers of website to 2013.

 * re-introduction of onMethod/onConstructor/onParam
 * tests checking error/warnings rewritten to be more heuristic, in order to accomodate difference in messaging between java6 and java 7
 * Ability to eliminate java's own output of erroneous error messages (heh); i.e. those messages that are invalidated by lombok's actions. This mechanism is used for onMethod/onConstructor/onParam
 * First steps to unifying a billion setGeneratedBy calls into a single visitor traversal for eclipse' HandleGetter/Setter/Constructor/Wither
 * To simplify 'zooming in' the tests on just a few files, added an 'accept' mechanism.
 * Updated copyright headers of website to 2013.

* Conflict due to adding topic() feature to logger in master, and 'field name' feature in config branch.
* master has since updated to shiny new eclipse dep versions and the 'ant eclipseForDebugging' feature, but this branch added deps. Addressed that.
* Renamed 'loggerCategory' to 'loggerTopic'. I know, that wasn't exactly right to do in a merge, but, there you have it.
* Test infrastructure changed in configuration branch, and tests had been added in master branch.

The LogDisabler used to simply suppress writes to standard out, but javac7 has a redesigned error system where errors are cached. Now the LogDisabler also wipes out any cached errors added in between a 'disable' and 'enable' session. Ironically we actually whined to Joe Darcy about javac6 emitting errors 'too early' and this caching system is the result. Heh.

This was already the case, but a disableLoggers() call HAS to be paired with an enableLoggers() call, so use try/finally.

Fixes issue #259.

* Conflict due to adding topic() feature to logger in master, and 'field name' feature in config branch.
* master has since updated to shiny new eclipse dep versions and the 'ant eclipseForDebugging' feature, but this branch added deps. Addressed that.
* Renamed 'loggerCategory' to 'loggerTopic'. I know, that wasn't exactly right to do in a merge, but, there you have it.
* Test infrastructure changed in configuration branch, and tests had been added in master branch.

We used to use the mango SPI processor, but this had two major issues:
* ecj wouldn't run annotation processors, requiring a separate proc:only compile run with javac
* mangoSPI couldn't do incremental compilation, so this required a full rebuild just to generate SPI files, every time.

Addressed by updating to IPP40 which does support explicit annotation processors even for ecj, and
adding our own SPI generating annotation processor to the build which can deal with incrementals.

There are some limits; removing a `@Provides` annotation on an existing type will need a full clean to pick that up, for example.
These limits seem quite exotic, though.

We used to use the mango SPI processor, but this had two major issues:
* ecj wouldn't run annotation processors, requiring a separate proc:only compile run with javac
* mangoSPI couldn't do incremental compilation, so this required a full rebuild just to generate SPI files, every time.

Addressed by updating to IPP40 which does support explicit annotation processors even for ecj, and
adding our own SPI generating annotation processor to the build which can deal with incrementals.

There are some limits; removing a `@Provides` annotation on an existing type will need a full clean to pick that up, for example.
These limits seem quite exotic, though.

This does break API for other plugins, but the fix is trivial: Just make your
'handle' method return void. That 'we won't call you again' business in the decks
never quite worked right anyway.

Also, you might want to call Javac.(recursive)setHandledBy when you generate nodes, now.

Specifically, Rawi01's patches to make javadoc behaviour in eclipse better,

As part of this commit, tests can be limited to ecj or eclipse, and I made cut-down
versions of a few tests (to run on ecj, as the main one cannot be, due to javadoc issues).

The tests now marked as eclipse only don't fail on ecj, but they don't generate the same
result. Alternatively, we could go with a separated out after-ecj and after-eclipse dir
instead, but that's perhaps going overboard.

This does break API for other plugins, but the fix is trivial: Just make your
'handle' method return void. That 'we won't call you again' business in the decks
never quite worked right anyway.

Also, you might want to call Javac.(recursive)setHandledBy when you generate nodes, now.

These handlers had methods with humongous argument lists, and they needed to grow even more in order

issue #164 is a race condition (the handled-or-not is a synchronized CAS check).

This does break API for other plugins, but the fix is trivial: Just make your
'handle' method return void. That 'we won't call you again' business in the decks
never quite worked right anyway.

Also, you might want to call Javac.(recursive)setHandledBy when you generate nodes, now.

This reverts commit 04c9755b39617a0e222a8e88ef44677b34044ab2.

The nature of the fix is to simply scan the TypeMirror for 'lombok shenanigans'; if it finds them, the type is not complete; if there are none, the type is.

This fundamentally does not work - lombok shenanigans may remain even if lombok is done (`@lombok.NonNull` for example), and lombok shenanigans don't just appear as annotations on the type; they can appear in many forms: Annotations on local var decls, or even method calls to `Lombok.safeDeNull` or whatnot. safeDenull is made up, but we might add it someday. `@Getter` on a field isn't though, and suffers from the same problem.

where _ANY_ mention of com.sun.tools.javac.tree.TreeMaker,
anywhere in a source file, would disable pretty much every
intelligent part of what makes the 'I' in IDE in eclipse:
No auto-complete, no 'go to declaration', etcetera, but only
since Eclipse Juno (not fixed in Kepler either). It's the
presence of src/stubs/com/sun/tools/javac/util/Context.java.

I've moved Context to a special stubs directory that's only used
for javac (so that we still get the benefit of getting some
warnings and such when making command line builds), and removed
the @Override annotations for where the stubbing is relevant
(for methods that exist in javac7 but not in javac6 on interfaces
we create implementations of). Furthermore, I did some extremely
tricky work in making our version actuall compatible with the
exact class signatures of both javac6- and javac7+'s versions;
generation of synthetic methods for reified type parameters was
causing havoc.

A big stack of 'here be voodoo' comments unfortunately added to
explain it all; necessary evil.

* Renamed 'loggerCategory' to 'loggerTopic'. I know, that wasn't exactly right to do in a merge, but, there you have it.
* Test infrastructure changed in configuration branch, and tests had been added in master branch.

I fixed it by still compiling against a given javac (we can only ship one lombok.jar after all), but having the test task run with a given bootclasspath and a given javac.jar.

There are 2 tasks that download both rt.jar and javac.jar for either OpenJDK6 or OpenJDK7, and it writes a properties file with those locations. The test task will use this property file, and explain what you need to do if it is not there.

Incidentally, this brought to light issue 422: Delombok in java7 produces VerifyErrors.","a295c4fc12247eedfe5747b547d8ac7079f33533","Reinier Zwitserloot"

I fixed it by still compiling against a given javac (we can only ship one lombok.jar after all), but having the test task run with a given bootclasspath and a given javac.jar.

as a separate cp entry, and thus it is not a bootclasspath item), and messes everything up.
The fix is to tell eclipse to compile various src/X folders to different 'bin' targets, which required
an update to ivyplusplus as well.

Specifically, Rawi01's patches to make javadoc behaviour in eclipse better,
which cannot be applied to ecj as you get load errors (javadoc not a thing there).

As part of this commit, tests can be limited to ecj or eclipse, and I made cut-down
versions of a few tests (to run on ecj, as the main one cannot be, due to javadoc issues).

The tests now marked as eclipse only don't fail on ecj, but they don't generate the same
result. Alternatively, we could go with a separated out after-ecj and after-eclipse dir
instead, but that's perhaps going overboard.

Specifically, Rawi01's patches to make javadoc behaviour in eclipse better,
which cannot be applied to ecj as you get load errors (javadoc not a thing there).

As part of this commit, tests can be limited to ecj or eclipse, and I made cut-down
versions of a few tests (to run on ecj, as the main one cannot be, due to javadoc issues).

The tests now marked as eclipse only don't fail on ecj, but they don't generate the same
result. Alternatively, we could go with a separated out after-ecj and after-eclipse dir
instead, but that's perhaps going overboard.

result. Alternatively, we could go with a separated out after-ecj and after-eclipse dir
instead, but that's perhaps going overboard.

This fundamentally does not work - lombok shenanigans may remain even if lombok is done (`@lombok.NonNull` for example), and lombok shenanigans don't just appear as annotations on the type; they can appear in many forms: Annotations on local var decls, or even method calls to `Lombok.safeDeNull` or whatnot. safeDenull is made up, but we might add it someday. `@Getter` on a field isn't though, and suffers from the same problem.

Lombok used to attempt to escape 'weird' chars (using a whitelist of chars that need no escaping) when writing out eclipse.ini.
However, there _is no_ escaping mechanism available there. Instead, apparently eclipse/java just reads the chars appearing after
the `-javaagent:` prefix as literally as possible. Therefore, just.. don't escape, and pray. Spaces, colons, and ats have all been confirmed
as working correctly when rendering them literally, and as failing when you attempt to escape them.

* Conflict due to adding topic() feature to logger in master, and 'field name' feature in config branch.
* master has since updated to shiny new eclipse dep versions and the 'ant eclipseForDebugging' feature, but this branch added deps. Addressed that.
* Renamed 'loggerCategory' to 'loggerTopic'. I know, that wasn't exactly right to do in a merge, but, there you have it.
* Test infrastructure changed in configuration branch, and tests had been added in master branch.
